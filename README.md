# Howey Wizard

## Introduction

Initial Coin Offering (ICO) is a new way to raise funds for companies and individuals in cryptocurrencies in exchange of tokens. Regulators in the U.S. (SEC) enforce to register assets as securities is they are securities. To figure out if your toke is security or not there is "Howey Test". We were impressed by Coindesk's [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QxOV2dgxO3C_TyVE0-41ZwLlzPmB-EE1NNshJGuedCU/htmlview#gid=0) and coded it as a wizard.


Howey Wizard is a client-side, serverless, open-source, free application.
